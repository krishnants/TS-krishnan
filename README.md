I am a MECHANICAL undergraduate at Nitte meenakshi Institute of Technology, Banglore ,one of the Premier Technical Institutes of India.I enjoy taking part in competetive contests like SAE. I undertook an internship at IIT Madras under the tutelage of kumar,  Head of Department of tool room.  Outside of academic interests, I am a singer. My persistent learning in the past years made me a confident singer and have placed many prizes. I continue to learn, compete and win music competitions at several college festivals. My other interest include playing football and basketball as part of my hostel and department teams.
